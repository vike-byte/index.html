<!-- (Harry)
make sure people scroll
make spaces longer? 
art project, not game, not how fast you can click through everything.
more images, more personal qoutes? (fake testimonies?), 
gathered that poeple were forced to work in office, how hard it is for families, 
being a mother by having to look through all things
red and green are things that are your mind

make red and green stuff clearer (ex: the financial sector)?

somehow make it so that the more you click the more you are a part of the class

almost an artist statement IN the piece?
write down on a piece of paper, each section and how it connects

made wiley wonder what the emotion i am trying to convey.  -->
