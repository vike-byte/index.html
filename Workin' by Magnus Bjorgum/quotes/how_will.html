"How will this affect your productivity?<br><br>
How will it affect your relationship with your colleagues and supervisors?<br><br>
How will you brainstorm with co-workers or put together a team to pursue a client, design a new product or compile a report <br><br>
How will you get support and feedback?<br><br>
What part of your job can you do easily, or better, at home?<br><br>
What part must be left for <a href="/ATUS.html" style="color: rgb(20, 196, 20);">your days</a> in the office?<br><br>
How will the company's goals remain a priority and still be met?<br><br>
How will you create a workplace in your home?<br><br>
How will you deliver materials back and forth to the office?<br><br>
How will customers or clients interact with you?"<br><br><br><br>
